# **git_HandsOn**

The Epigenetics subjects of MSc in Omics Data Analysis at UVIC-UCC has utilized git HandsOn as a training exercise to become familiar with using git and GitHub Branches.

The following branches are included in it: main (master) and fix. In addition, nucleotide_percentage.py is a group project with another user.

## **Scripts**

The `seqClass.py` tool enables users to determine whether a user-introduced sequence (-s) is DNA or RNA. Moreover, it indicates whether the user-introduced motif (-m) is included in the sequence.

The nucleotide percentage in a user-provided DNA or RNA sequence (-seq) is determined using the `nucleotide_percentage.py` script. This script will be revised together with another author.
