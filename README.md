# *git_HandsOn*

The MSc in Omics Data Analysis at UVIC-UCC has utilized git HandsOn as a training exercise to become familiar with using git and GitHub Branches.

The following branches are included in it: main (master), fix, and practical, which is a group project with another student. Information on the joint project with another student is available in the repository git HandsOn collab.

## Scripts

The seqClass.py tool enables users to determine whether a user-introduced sequence (-s) is DNA or RNA. Moreover, it indicates whether the user-introduced motif (-m) is included in the sequence.
The nucleotide percentage in a user-provided DNA or RNA sequence (-s) is determined using the seqnt proportion.py script. This script will be revised together with another author.
